        <p><b>The Tesla Model S is an all-electric five-door liftback sedan produced by Tesla, Inc., and was introduced on June 22, 2012. As of August 2020, the Model S Long Range Plus has an EPA range of 402 miles (647 km), higher than that of any other battery electric car.

            Model S cars built from October 2014 have a feature called Autopilot, an advanced driver assistance system that allows the car to operate without assistance from the driver. However, the driver must supervise continuously and take control if there is an issue. Autopilot 2.0, introduced in October 2016, also includes “Enhanced Summon”, which allows the car to navigate through a parking lot to its owner without anyone in the driver's seat.Sentry mode, available on cars built after August 2017, senses and records suspicious activity around the car.
            
            In 2013, the Model S became the first electric car to top the monthly new-car-sales ranking in any country, twice leading in Norway, in September and December 2013 and also in Denmark in December 2015. Global Model S sales passed 250,000 units in September 2018 (more recent numbers are not available because Tesla combines sales of Model S and Model X). The U.S. is its leading market, with about 158,000 units delivered through December 2019. The Tesla Model S was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016.</b></p>
